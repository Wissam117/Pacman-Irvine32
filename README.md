# PACMAN Assembly Game

This repository contains a basic implementation of the classic Pacman game using 32-bit assembly language and the Irvine32 library. The project was developed in Visual Studio 2022 Community edition. Notably, this implementation avoids using any high-level control flow constructs like if-else or for/while loops; instead, it relies on labels and `cmp` operations for control flow and comparisons.
