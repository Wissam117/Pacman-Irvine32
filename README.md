# PACMAN Assembly Game

This repository contains a basic implementation of the classic Pacman game using 32-bit assembly language and the Irvine32 library. The project was developed in Visual Studio 2022 Community edition. Notably, this implementation avoids using any high-level control flow constructs like if-else or for/while loops; instead, it relies on labels and `cmp` operations for control flow and comparisons.

write a readme.md for github for the following repository in which I incorporated mit license:I've done a basic implementaion of pacman using irvine32 and 32 bit assembly on visual studio 2022 community. I've not made use of any if or special loop directives like if-else and for/while. All loops and comparison done with the help of labels and cmp operation.
